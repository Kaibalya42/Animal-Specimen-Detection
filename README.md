This project implements and compares three convolutional neural network architectures—ZFNet, VGG16, and GoogLeNet (InceptionV3)—for animal species classification using the Animals-10 dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. Each model's performance is analyzed based on accuracy and training time, with visualizations of learning curves to understand model behavior and effectiveness in classifying animal specimens.
